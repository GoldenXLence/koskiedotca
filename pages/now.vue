      <p>Hello! This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com">/now page</a>. This is a place where I will update with what is going on in my life right now. It will be less of a real time update feed and more of a, "oh, so that's what he's up to..." kinda thing.</p>

      <p>Recently I've been trying to be more mindful about how I spend my time and one of the ways I look to acheive this is through the use of a pocket notebook and some mild journaling. For my notebok, I picked up a 3 pack of the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> note books, specificaly the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/heartland">Heartland pack.</a></p>
